## 1. BCCWS

### 1.1 Data Clean

Cleaning the BCCWS is done with several step, which will be executed here using a single function.

## 2. PSSS

### 2.1 Data Format

The PSSS is in a different format than the BCCCW, and therefore requires a separate data processing step to wrangle the data into the 169 core fields of the Bird Monitoring Data Exchange ([BMDE](https://naturecounts.ca/nc/default/nc_bmde.jsp)). The following function will do this step for you.

```{r PSSS-BMDE, warning=FALSE}  

source("PSSS_BMDE.R")  

#Write to Data folder in working directory 
write.csv(PSSS, "Data/PSSS.csv") 
#read from Data folder in working directory 
PSSS<-read.csv("Data/PSSS.csv")}
```
