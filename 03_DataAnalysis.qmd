# Data Analysis - Species Trends

## 3 International and National Assessments

A first assessment of coastal waterbird trends will be done for the full extent of the Salish Sea, and for each country separately. This is done on a species-by-species basis and is done without using a spatially explicit model to start. 

### 3.1 International Assessment

```{r}

#Load your saved species data 
sp.data<-read.csv("Data/sp.data.csv")
#Load your saved events data which is needed for zero-filling
events<-read.csv("Data/events.csv")

#Create a list of species
sp.list<-unique(sp.data$SpeciesCode)

#Create a data frame to store the results. 
#This is the template used for the State of Canada's Birds and is required for upload into NatureCounts
site <- "SalishSea"
source("OutputTables.R")

#Select the minimum data requirements for the analysis. The once selected here are consistent with Ethier et al. (2020). Specifically, (i.e., species with > 85% zero counts across all routes and years, species that had a mean abundance per year < 10, and species that were detected in fewer than one-half of the survey years). Users may choose to adjust these parameters. 

min.abundance <- 10
min.years <- (Y2-Y1)/2
zero.count<-0.85

#Now we can initiate the analysis.  
source("Analysis.R")
